# 6dof-attitude-control-simulation
Educational 6-DOF rigid-body simulation with PID-based attitude control using MATLAB/Simulink
## Overview
This repository contains an educational 6-DOF rigid-body simulation
implemented in MATLAB/Simulink using Simscape Multibody.

The focus is on PID (PD) attitude control (pitch/yaw) using control surfaces.
The project is intended for learning and control-theory experimentation.
